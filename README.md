# fork of zlib  

This is a fork of repository [madler/zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib).  

## zlib documentations  
 1. [zlib-web](https://zlib.net/)  
 

## reasons of forking this repository are  

### 1. separate source files from project parts.  
Every developer familiar with its individual IDE, can create its own IDE configuration file and work with library.  

### 2. slightly modify in order to be able to compile on windows 10 core iot (arm)  
  
### 3. prepare tools and APIs for compression and decompression blobs
